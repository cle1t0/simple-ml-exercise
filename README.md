# simple-ml-exercise
This is a simple binary classifier IÂ´ve built as an exercise for my professor at uni. It uses a simple dataset of numerical coordinates.

The exercise was to build a classification model for the given coordinates, classifing into two classes: red and blue.

The vetRots archives are different extensions of the the same dataset used.

The division boundary beetween the red and the blue classes is not linear as stated before by my professor.
